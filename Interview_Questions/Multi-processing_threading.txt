The main difference between a multi-process and a multi-threaded approach lies in
how concurrent execution is achieved:
1. Multi-process: In a multi-process approach, multiple processes are created, each having its own memory
   space and resources. Each process runs independently and can execute different parts of the program simultaneously.
   Processes communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as pipes, sockets,
   or shared memory. Each process has its own copy of the program code and data, and they are isolated from each other,
   providing strong separation and protection. However, the overhead of process creation and IPC can be higher
   compared to threads.

2. Multi-threaded: In a multi-threaded approach, multiple threads are created within a single process. Threads share
  the same memory space, file descriptors, and other process resources. They run concurrently within the process and
  can communicate and share data more easily than processes, as they can directly access shared memory. Threads are
  lighter-weight compared to processes, as they don't require separate memory spaces. However, care must be taken to
  properly synchronize access to shared resources to avoid data races or other concurrency issues.

Here are some key differences between the two approaches:
- Memory and resources: In a multi-process approach, each process has its own memory space and resources, while in a
  multi-threaded approach, threads share the same memory space and resources within a process.

- Communication: Processes communicate through IPC mechanisms, while threads can communicate more efficiently through
  shared memory and direct function calls.

- Context switching: Switching between processes involves more overhead due to the need to save and restore the entire
  process state. Thread context switching within a process is faster because it involves switching between
  thread-specific execution contexts within the same memory space.

- Isolation: Processes are isolated from each other, meaning that a crash or error in one process does not affect
  others. In contrast, threads within a process share the same memory space, so an error in one thread can potentially
  affect the entire process.

- Scalability: Multi-threading can be more efficient in terms of resource usage since it avoids the overhead of
  creating and managing multiple processes. However, multi-threaded programs need to carefully handle
  synchronization and avoid data races.

The choice between a multi-process or multi-threaded approach depends on factors such as the nature of the
problem, the desired level of isolation and resource sharing, the need for scalability, and the programming
language and frameworks being used. Each approach has its own advantages and considerations, and the decision
should be based on the specific requirements of the application.
